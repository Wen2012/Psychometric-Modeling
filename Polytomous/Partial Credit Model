This tutorial is based on Masters' paper "A Rasch Model for Partial Credit Scoring" in Psychometrika (June,1982).

Summary:
1. A rasch model is developed for the analysis of partial credit data.
* additivity of parameters in the exponent of the model can be separated and estimated independent of each other.
* sufficient statistics for the model parameters
* objective comparisons of persons and items from graded responses are possible

2. Ordered category data:
* partial credit scoring
* repeated trials
* counts
* rating scales

3. parameter separability 


4. catetory boundaries (Edwards and Thurstone, 1952; Samejima,1969)

5. Partial credit model

6. Rating scale model (Andrich, 1978b)

7. unconditional maximum likelihood procedure for estimating the parameters in PCM

8. Real data: PCM for the analysis of a prekindergarten screening test
